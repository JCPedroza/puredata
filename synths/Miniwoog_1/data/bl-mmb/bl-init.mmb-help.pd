#X text 53 90 WAVETABLE INITIALIZATION FOR BL.MMB OBJECTS;
#X text 41 116 This objects generates the wavetables used by the bl.mmb
bandlimited oscillators. It takes as its argument a name that the other
objects can associate with it. The argument is not required \, however
\, and multiple oscillators can read from the same instance of [bl-init.mmb].
So if you have one in the parent patch \, all bl.mmb oscillators with
the same argument can use it. If no argument is provided \, it defaults
to the name 0 \, which is usually fine. The argument is really only
there for use in reusable abstractions to avoid potential "multiply
defined table" errors.;
