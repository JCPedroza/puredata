- Implement atoms as abstractions instead of subpatches, and use the 
  creation argument (dollar sign) to assign an atom number, see:
  http://en.flossmanuals.net/pure-data/ch043_dollar-signs/
  http://en.flossmanuals.net/pure-data/ch042_abstractions/ 

- Add more non-linear time offset modes.

- Maybe change/improve pendulum mode? Is the length variable well 
  implemented? Can the formula be implemented in a different way?
  (maybe in another version?)

- Make an analogish/smooth mode or version. (maybe in another version?)
