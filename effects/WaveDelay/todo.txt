- Some pan dynamic. (expansion and something more, maybe movement?)

- Maybe change/improve pendulum mode? (or make an alternative one?)
  Is the length variable well implemented? Can the formula be 
  implemented in a different way?
  (maybe in another version?)

- Make it so pendulum, cubert, etc math that doesn't work with megative offset
  works with negative offsets!
